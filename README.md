# Automatic-Number-Plate-Recognition-System
Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) is a crucial computer vision application that has seen widespread adoption in industries like transportation, law enforcement, and smart city infrastructure. By capturing images of vehicle license plates and extracting alphanumeric characters, ANPR systems automate critical processes, from toll collection to traffic monitoring. With artificial intelligence and image processing advancements, ANPR systems now achieve remarkable accuracy and speed, adapting to complex scenarios such as low-light conditions and high-speed vehicle movement.

The need for ANPR systems arises from the growing demand for efficient and automated solutions in traffic management. With the exponential increase in the number of vehicles on roads, manually managing traffic violations and toll collections has become a daunting task. ANPR systems alleviate this burden by providing a reliable, scalable, and automated alternative that can operate 24/7. In addition to managing traffic, ANPR systems also enhance security by tracking vehicles in sensitive areas such as airports and government buildings.
